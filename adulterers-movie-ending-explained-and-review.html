It is revealed that the second act of the movie is not real.</p><p>Near the end of the movie, we see Samuel’s co-worker from his workplace Lola come to check on him as he was present at the work for the day.</p><p>She bangs the door many times but getting no response she writes a note for him and sends it inside the house.</p><p>She then finds Samuel’s truck at the side of his house. The scene shows inside the house where Samuel is sitting on a sofa in front of his wife Ashely who is eating something. Beside Ashely, we see Damien’s deceased body.</p><p>Then Samuel is seen in the garden at the back of his house near the rose bed. He is seen covering Damien’s body with soil. In the background, we see a chair along with a garden table with pink glass on the top.</p><figure></figure><p>But when the scene changes, we see Samuel’s wife Ashely lighting up her cigarette. Samuel looks back at his wife and his wife keeps on looking at him. He returns to shoveling the soil to bury the body.</p><p>Samuel looks back when his wife calls but there is no one on the chair. He calls for her but there is only the burning cigarette. Then he is hit with the truth that, his wife is already deceased&nbsp;and he has just buried her with his lover.</p><p>Slowly, the camera focuses on Samuel’s eyes. He is taken back to the time when he had taken two guns to his wife’s room but there laid two perished bodies of his wife and her lover. The time is shown to be 1:45 pm when he comes down from the bedroom upstairs.</p><p>Coming down, he sits on the sofa and stares at the gift he had brought for his wife. Then he realizes that whatever conversation he had with Ashely and Damien was only inside his head. He screams and despairs at the revelation. Then slowly he falls to the side of the sofa.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-adulterers-based-on-real-story></span>Is Adulterers Based On Real Story?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The movie Adulterers is based on true events but it is a real story. Based on what director and writer H.M. Coakley said about the movie, the movie is based on what happened on to his family member a long time ago. Not the death part but only the adultery part.</p><figure></figure><p>That made him think about what he would have done if something like that had happened to him. The whole movie is based on what alternative ending he would have followed if something similar happened to him.</p><p>Something like this movie can never be said to be based on a true story because the whole movie is based on what if. Therefore, the director may say that the movie is a true story but the movie is not a true story.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=adulterers-movie-plot-summary-and-synopsis></span>Adulterers Movie Plot Summary and Synopsis<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the movie Adulterers, Samuel is working as an assistant manager at a hardware store in New Orleans. The day was his marriage anniversary.</p><p>He wanted to good day with his wife Ashley and he wanted to surprise her by coming home early. So, he calls to tell her that he won’t be able to come home early as he had to cover shifts for someone.</p><p>After his call, his co-worker Lola is very flirtatious with him but he is very devoted to his wife. He picks a box of chocolate for his wife along with a bouquet of flowers.</p><p>After reaching his house, he puts the chocolate and the flowers on the table and waits for his wife to come from her work from her waiting shift.</p><p>But then he sees her purse on the table and some grunting voice from upstairs. He goes upstairs silently, only to find his wife in another person’s arms.</p><p>Deranged from the scene, he goes downstairs, grabs two handguns, comes back upstairs, and shoots both adulterous couples into cold bodies.</p><p>Then it shows that it was just his imagination. But this time, he goes into the room and confronts both of them, and threatens them with the gun at gunpoint.</p><p>He forces them to answer how long their relationship has been going on and their adulterous details.</p><figure></figure><p>Distressed emotionally and physically, the man named Damien admits that he is married to Jasmine and this was not the first time he cheated on his wife.</p><p>Ashley explains herself as a broken person as she was in an abusive relationship with her ex-husband. Even before that, she had been sexually assaulted by her father’s employer many times.</p><p>Then Samuel makes Damien call his wife and reveals the truth about his cheating husband.</p><p>Hearing that, she breaks down and comes to Samuel’s house, has intercourse with him in front of her husband, and tells Samuel to deal with her husband however he wants to deal with him.</p><p>After some bantering, Samuel comes toward Damien and the gunshot is heard. Later the couple is seen in front of each other with Damien’s body along with them.</p><p>Ashley watches her husband as he buries the body of Damien only to disappear. Samuel remembers that he had already shot his wife and her lover and killed them when he shot them in the beginning.</p><p>The entire conversation Samuel had with Ashley and Damien was only his imagination.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=fans-reviews-and-reaction></span>Fan’s Reviews And Reaction<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>According to&nbsp;IMDb, the rating of the movie is 5.1 out of 10 which signifies it’s an average movie.
