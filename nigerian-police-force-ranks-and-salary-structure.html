The force as we have it today was established in 1930 and had a motto that says, “Police is Your Friend.” The colors on its flag are horizontally striped blue, yellow, and green. </span><span>The security system is designed to provide one police command for every state in Nigeria. This makes a total of thirty-six commands for all thirty-six (36) states in Nigeria.</span></p><p><span>The commands are further grouped into twelve (12) zones, and there are seven different administrative branches that regulate these zones. With over two thousand (2000) police stations spread across the nation, the police system is hierarchical. The duties assigned to an officer and what the officer earns are dependent on the officer’s rank. Here is a breakdown of the Nigerian Police Force rank and how much is paid for each rank.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ranks-in-the-nigerian-police-force-in-ascending-order></span><b>Ranks in the Nigerian Police Force in Ascending Order</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li><span>Constable</span></li><li><span>Lance Corporal</span></li><li><span>Corporal</span></li><li><span>Sergeant</span></li><li><span>Sergeant Major</span></li><li><span>Inspector of Police</span></li><li><span>Assistant Superintendent of Police</span></li><li><span>Deputy Superintendent of Police</span></li><li><span>Superintendent of Police</span></li><li><span>Chief Superintendent of Police</span></li><li><span>Assistant Commissioner of Police</span></li><li><span>Deputy Commissioner of Police</span></li><li><span>Commissioner of Police</span></li><li><span>Assistant Inspector-General of Police</span></li><li><span>Deputy Inspector-General of Police</span></li><li><span>Inspector General</span></li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=salaries-for-the-different-ranks-of-the-police-force></span><b>Salaries for the Different Ranks of the Police Force</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The salaries of police officers vary depending on the rank of the officer.

class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Generally, promotion within the Nigerian Police Force is supposed to be according to the date a member was enlisted or the date of last promotion. Other factors like performance in the promotion exams are also put into consideration. This promotion usually follows the sequence of the ranks. Officers gradually climb the ladder to the top.</span></p><p><span>However, there is room for Special Promotion, an approved promotional pattern where an officer with outstanding performance is promoted above the next expected rank. Unfortunately, </span><span>the promotional system of the force is not fair and just</span><span>. It favors Nigerian Police Force members who are close to high-ranking officers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While officers are promoted to other ranks, the position of the Inspector General of Police is more of a political appointment. The IGP receives their appointment from the president, who is also at liberty to sack the IGP at any time. This office lasts for four tenures, after which another officer is appointed.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=incentives-and-allowances-of-the-nigerian-police-force></span><b>Incentives and Allowances of the Nigerian Police Force</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Serving in the Nigerian Police Force usually attracts some benefits such as housing allowance and other welfare packages. Compensation is also given to family members of officers who lose their lives in service to the country. However, like other sectors of the country, the police force suffers many setbacks, and </span><span>these benefits are hardly given to members</span><span>. When they are given, it is more of a ceremonial showoff as the supposed beneficiaries still end up complaining that their needs weren’t catered for.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-join-the-nigerian-police-force></span><b>How to Join the Nigerian Police Force</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>There are two primary ways through which Nigerian citizens can become members of the Nigerian Police Force. The first is by joining the </span><span>Nigerian Police Academy</span><span> (Polac), and the second is by joining as a graduate through the </span><span>cadet ASP</span><span> program. The two methods of recruitment have different procedures and requirements. People who want to join the force are generally called police recruits and are paid ₦9,019.42 monthly and ₦108,233 yearly.</span></p><p><span>The Nigerian Police Academy training lasts for over four years, and applicants must be within seventeen to twenty-five years old. Other requirements include physical fitness and wellness, Senior School Certificate Examination result with at least a credit in Mathematics and English; female applicants must not be pregnant, etc.</span></p><p><span>The cadet ASP program, which runs for nine to twelve months, is open to graduates of recognized universities and polytechnics. Applicants are to fall within the age range of twenty to twenty-eight and are to fulfill other requirements. It is important to note that officers who join the force through Polac get promoted faster than those who join through the cadet ASP program.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKaZnLKztcCnZKmnnJ6wpnnFqKmcnV2nrq%2B30maYp5xdqK6trdGyZKysoqqwtcHRnmY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnigerian-police-force-ranks-and-salary-structure.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnigerian-police-force-ranks-and-salary-structure.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnigerian-police-force-ranks-and-salary-structure.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnigerian-police-force-ranks-and-salary-structure.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnigerian-police-force-ranks-and-salary-structure.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnigerian-police-force-ranks-and-salary-structure.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sarah-jessica-parker-gives-rare-shout-out-to-rarely-seen-daughter-tabitha-15.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sarah-jessica-parker-gives-rare-shout-out-to-rarely-seen-daughter-tabitha-15.html>Sarah Jessica Parker gives rare shout-out to rarely-seen daughter Tabitha, 15</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jos%C3%A9-luis-pineda-sierra.html>Jos Luis Pineda Sierra</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jos%C3%A9-luis-pineda-sierra.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
