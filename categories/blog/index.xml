These locks were designed exclusively for self-storage facilities and have been the industry standard since their introduction. Bolt cutters cannot be used to remove disc locks because the hasp (or the U-shaped component of a padlock) cannot be accessed from the inside. A disc lock cannot be broken apart with a hammer, unlike a padlock or a keyless lock, which may be done with a hammer.
Is it possible to cut a disc lock using bolt cutters in this situation?</description></item><item><title>Inside Yewande Adekoyas Marriage to Husband and the Children they Share</title><link>/inside-yewande-adekoya-s-marriage-to-husband-and-the-children-they-share.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/inside-yewande-adekoya-s-marriage-to-husband-and-the-children-they-share.html</guid><description>Yewande Adekoya was married for 8 years to actor Abiodun Ishola Thomas.
