A little more than a month ago, photographs captured Spelling leaving a budget motel with her children.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>This motel stay comes in the wake of her ongoing divorce proceedings with Dean McDermott, her husband of 18 years, and an announcement that their marital home had been infested with mold, causing severe health issues for her family. In an unexpected twist, <a class="ae -U" href=#>Spelling</a> has traded her luxurious surroundings for the simplicity of a motel room and, later, an RV.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The actress, now 50 years old, has been seen living in a Sunseeker E450 RV in Ventura County, accompanied by her children Liam, Stella, Hattie, Finn, and Beau.
