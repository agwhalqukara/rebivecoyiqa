The couple met in 1989, somewhere in Arlington while Steve was still a stand-up comedian. They got married 7 years later in 1996, only to divorce in 2005.&nbsp;Their marriage took a very ugly turn during the divorce process.</p><p>Mary made countless cruel accusations, including calling Steve Harvey out in court for destroying her life and subjecting her to a crippling lifestyle.&nbsp;Without proof, the court deemed her allegations baseless and paid no attention to them.&nbsp;After their divorce, Wynton Brycelon Ali Harvey was handed to his father, Steve Harvey, as he won custody.</p><p>At the same time, the court awarded his mother ownership of three of the houses she shared with Steve, a $1.5 million payment, and a monthly payment of $40,000.
